                        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) provides for a faster and more adaptive approach to extending and building a 
                        great solution. Building a CI/CD pipeline that leverages Blue-Green deployments helps ensure new code going out is able to be tested and ran in
                        an environment that is identical to what customers/users will experience. A very integral part to having a comprehensive and efficient CI/CD implementation is
                        having regression testing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorough regression testing as code is pushed out to the predecessor server helps ensure the code has been well tested. What is better than thorough regression 
                        testing? Thorough regression testing that is completely automated. Automating the regression testing for a solution helps ensure reliability and security. This 
                        helps cut down on errors that are introduced to customers/users.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my team at Blackbaud, there were many parts that needed to come together to get CI/CD with Blue-Green deployments running. Luckily Microsoft's Azure has a lot 
                        of useful information to help set a lot of this up. Having a smart team helps too. I did not drive too much of the Azure setup, but I was able to shadow many of the
                        pivotal steps needed like configuring the settings within the Azure Portal.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majority of my work/effort for this project was building out our automated end to end testing. To write these, we used Playwright for Node.js. We used the Playwright 
                        Test test runner. This allowed us to run tests across multiple browsers, execute tests at the same time, and capture screenshots during execution of testing. We 
                        ultimately added 31 suites/tests to automate the testing of major functionality within our solution at the time of typing this. I suspect we will have more in the 
                        future. We have added a Playwright test consideration within our planning of new features.</i>

                        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Python, I built a simple pair of scripts that automate the once manual process used to fetch US Public School and Public District data. It is important to 
                        have reliable data that you can rely on. For US Schools and Districts, the government provides data a handful of times a year. For some time, my previous project 
                        manager had to manually navigate to the government site to download the data. This was a tedious process as the website was pretty dated. The data was divided by 
                        each of the states and territories in the US. Add about 4 clicks to get to each download for each state/territory made for a lot of clicks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help my project manager out, I built a selenium web driver based script in Python that went and downloaded all these files for him. This script did take a bit to 
                        run. However, the time the script could complete in vs. that of my project manager was not very comparable. Something that would take a couple hours for my project 
                        manager took about 20 minutes.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did I automate the downloading of these files, I helped speed up and automate another process my project manager had to do. After downloading the files, 
                        my project manager would then have to combine them into a singular file. I wrote the script to do this for him as well. These files were just Excel files, but 
                        the formatting of these files was a bit strange in that there was a graphic within the first few columns/rows. This was pretty simple to get around and the whole 
                        script took a very tedious process and cut it down tremendously while freeing up my project manager.</i>

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the YourCause teams I was on got to Blackbaud, we did not have Multifactor Authentication (MFA) setup for 
                          entering our site. After getting to Blackbaud, we had to implement some pretty important security measures like MFA. To implement this functionality, 
                          we implemented within our logging in process, obviously. We have users pass a code sent to their user account's email. The user can opt to have us remember their 
                          device which will not prompt them for an MFA code so long as they've entered it in within the last 30 days and have elected to remember their specific device. These 
                          remembrances can be cleared at any time within the 30 days. After that time, they automatically expire. Although this functionality is limited to only supplying the 
                          MFA code to the user account's email, the code is easily extendible for expanding to other options like an app. or mobile device.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to get into too many details with our password changes for obvious reasons. However, what I can say is that we added a lot more 
                          complexity to what is an acceptable password. It helps ensure a set number of characters and symbols while also providing additional features only further increase the 
                          strength and resilience of user passwords within our product.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <b>Splunk, Mixpanel, and other Logging:</b>
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important security measure we were asked to introduce to our solution was more robust monitoring. We implemented Splunk 
                          logging so different actions and abilities get logged along with other security related and code related information. This help increase visibility into 
                          the actions users take. Furthermore, we also adopted a similar technology for our frontend code. We implemented Mixpanel to log and record the steps and 
                          actions users take and do. Obviously this information is available in the App Insights with the Azure Portal, however, Mixpanel offers a more user friendly 
                          and customizable solution that can be used for a vast range of purposes including increasing security/visibility within our product.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these two forms of logging, I introduced a job that scans our API's log table to monitor it so that if so many errors have happened over a certain time range 
                          or if a there are any fatal errors, we are made aware immediately. This helps ensure we are "actively" monitoring our solution while allowing us to act quick and 
                          reliably when issues happen to come up.

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who enjoys having floating SAS tokens out there. That isn't good for many reasons but better yet, what if you didn't even need SAS tokens to 
                          serve files to your users? This is an idea that further allows you to lock down access to the location of files for your product such that only certain IP addresses 
                          can access it or  maybe just a singular IP address can access it, like the IP address of where your site is hosted.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to do this, I built a set of authenticated endpoints that help to serve files to our users. Instead of having places return links to 
                          the storage account in Azure, instead, our API returns an endpoint call to itself such that our UI makes a request to our API for the file. This allows us to access 
                          the file and then serve it ourselves. Luckily our files have a size limit which helps reduce any slowness that could come from doing this for large files.</i>

            <p class="w3-text-black"><i>Cybersecurity is a broad, dynamic, and ever changing field that is difficult to integrate into undergraduate 
              Computer Science curriculum. The absence of sanitized labs coupled with the requirement of specialized faculty to 
              teach the subject pose obstacles many undergraduate colleges face in adopting cybersecurity education. In this 
              paper we describe a pilot lab that is part of the education modules of the project CyberPaths. This project aims 
              to offer a solution to cybersecurity education for primarily undergraduate liberal arts institutions. We present a 
              pilot study that tested a denial of service learning lab in a general education course at Wofford College that has 
              received very positive feedback from students.</i>
