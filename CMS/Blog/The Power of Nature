<div><h3 style="text-align: center;">The Power of Nature</h3><p style="text-align: left;">It is often a challenge being a full-time student that is sociable, that has a job, and that has other obligations and commitments to various clubs and organizations. Needless to say, my time is often preoccupied with productive activities that do not leave me with too much free time. As a result, there are many activities that I enjoy very much that I am unable to frequently partake in due to lack of available time. However, when I do find myself having a significant amount of free time, it is usually on either Saturday or Sunday and depends upon the upcoming week. When I find myself with a Saturday or Sunday that I have open, I like to spend most of it within nature.</p><img src="images/CMS/Blog/1.jpg" alt="1" style="width:500px;height:500px;text-align: center;"><p style="text-align: left;">I enjoy nature because when my time is preoccupied with obligations from either academics, work, or other clubs and organizations, I am usually wrapped in technology. Most of my academics are computer science related and I often spend a significant chunk of time on the computer for my computer science classes. Even my philosophy classes have me on the computer frequently writing papers. Work is similar as I am a Web Developer for Wofford College's Information Management. Obviously, this requires almost all of my time when working be surrounded by technology. My time preoccupied with various clubs and organizations doesn't tend to be filled with too much technology, but my time during these commitments is important to the club or organization I am a part of. Consequently, my full attention during these times is not directed to necessarily my own interests, but my attention is directed to the club or organization I am a part of.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Though I do enjoy technologies, hence why I elected to study computer science; learning new technologies; playing video games; and other hobbies revolving around various technologies, I think it is important to disconnect from technology as well as the world when possible for at least a little. Almost everything that I do when I do not have free time keeps my mind busy. I never have a long time to truly slow down and just let my mind be during the week. This is why I love doing things in nature when I can.</p><p style="text-align: left;">When I am in nature, either hiking, trail running, kayaking or whatever it might be, I am able to truly disconnect from the world. Being in nature and away from any interaction with technologies, besides my Bluetooth headphones and music, usually, allows me to focus my attention on nature and whatever might cross my mind. Nature provides a means for me to be able to bracket off thinking about the things that I must think about during the week. Nature allows my mind to be free in that I am able to think about whatever comes to me. During the week I am thinking about whatever obligation I am doing and nature allows me to escape this. More importantly, the power of nature causes me to slow down and take in the world as it is in its pure form. When I am in nature, nature seems to always have the power to keep me from thinking about all that happened during the week. Nature allows me to think about and ponder the expanse and beauty of nature along with whatever may come to my mind. There is no better place to relax and unwind from the world than on top of a mountain all alone or looking at a beautiful waterfall. Nor is anything more serene than looking upon the power and expanse of nature.</p><img src="images/CMS/Blog/2.jpg" alt="2" style="width:500px;height:500px;text-align: center;"></div>
