<div><h3 style="text-align: center;">"What's Your Major?" Computer Science and Philosophy. "Why the Philosophy?"</h3><p style="text-align: left;">I wasn't always a philosophy major. My original intention when entering college was to solely pursue a computer science major. This has always been the plan ever since I picked up a book on PHP in my local library during my sophomore year of high school. I had little to no experience with computers besides the general knowledge of a high school kid. However, after understanding the power of programming and the possibilities of programming, I was hooked; I still am.</p><p style="text-align: left;">So then, how does Philosophy come into the mix? I credit my liberal arts education with introducing philosophy to me. Obviously, I knew about philosophy much before college; I was in the philosophy club in high school. However, Wofford College makes all its students meet general education requirements. Now, this Blog entry isn't about the value of a liberal arts education, but if it wasn't for such requirements I would have never been in Logic and Critical Reasoning.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The connection between logic and computer science is an obvious one for many. But this wasn't the case for me initially. It wasn't until looking at De Morgan's laws in my philosophy class. Looking at De Morgan's laws is when I had the epiphany of the connection between philosophy and computer science. This connection would continue to grow as I continued my college education.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The importance of logic with regard to computer science became even more evident to me when I took a class about the architecture and hardware of computers. We explored logic gates, different parts of a computer, and how everything fits together between hardware and software. This is a very important class and was it was interesting taking this class and building a personal PC of my own afterward over winter break. Nonetheless, another topic in philosophy would spring up in another computer science class I took. This time the computer science class in question was artificial intelligence.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Artificial Intelligence was arguably one of my favorite classes I have ever taken. Not only did we get to program in the Scheme programming language, which was a language and style of language that I had no experience in, but we explored the many facets and challenges of artificial intelligence. Thus, we briefly looked at the philosophical underpinnings of artificial intelligence. Some of these include trusting such technologies using artificial intelligence, problems of morality, and ideas of sentience/autonomy.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Throughout these various connections and others, I learned to appreciate the importance of philosophy. In doing so, I decided to pursue a major in philosophy. Now I am currently writing a 20-page paper for the capstone of my philosophy major, and my topic is connected to my main interest, computer science. My topic resolves around superintelligence and trusting superintelligence. Though philosophy and computer science are not often seen pertaining to one another, the importance of philosophy and computer science together is increasingly important with the advancement of technology and artificial intelligence.</p><p style="text-align: left;">When people ask me what I am studying in college and I respond with computer science and philosophy, they always ask, "Why the philosophy too?" I then explain the above to them.</p></div>
