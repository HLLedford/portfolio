<div><h3 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h3><p>Just in case you didn't catch my name from my site's URL, my name is Harrison Ledford. I am presently a senior at Wofford College. I am a double major and double minor that will graduate in the spring, May 20th to be exact. My two majors are Computer Science and Philosophy, and my two minors are Math and Art History. My main pursuit throughout college, really beginning the latter part of high school, was Computer Science. Pursuing Math has been extremely valuable in conjunction with Computer Science. The two together are extremely helpful in many applications. My other two studious pursuits, Philosophy and Art History, are very interesting to me and help me keep knowledgeable in other areas. They do have some relevant applications in conjunction with Computer Science too.</p><p>Besides class, I am very active at my college. I am a tutor for many computer science classes, and I am in a number of clubs and organizations. If I am not doing those things, then I am most likely working. I work for Wofford College's Information Management. My 3 years working in IM at Wofford College have allowed me to produce many different applications and programs using many different technologies and for many different purposes (Check out my Projects section).</p><p>When I do truly have free time, I am either staying active, surrounded by technology, or learning something new. I am an avid runner and generally run about 30 miles a week. I love to hike, trail run, and just be outside when I can. Other interests of mine are gaming, guitar, programming, and volunteering.</p><p>Feel free to check out any of my Projects, Blog entries and or links/contacts above. I will periodically be updating my Projects and Blog sections of my site when I have the time.</p></div>
